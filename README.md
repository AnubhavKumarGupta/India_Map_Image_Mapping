# India_Map_Image_Mapping

- This project showcases an interactive map of India with clickable regions that direct users to the tourism websites of different states and neighboring countries.
- The map is created using HTML's `<map>` and `<area>` elements for defining hotspots on the image of India.

## Features

- **Image Map**: The map of India has been divided into various circular hotspots representing different states and nearby countries.
- **Clickable Regions**: Each clickable region is linked to the official tourism websites of the respective states/countries.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage adjusts according to the screen size, offering a user-friendly experience across different devices.

## How It Works

- The image `map.jpg` is used as a base.
- Each region is marked using the `<area>` element inside a `<map>`. The shape of each clickable region is a circle defined by coordinates and radius.
- When a user clicks on any state or country, they are directed to the respective tourism website in a new tab.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: (linked through `style.css`) for styling the webpage (you can define your custom styles here).
- **Image Mapping**: Used for creating interactive clickable areas on the image.
